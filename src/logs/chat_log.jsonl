It\u2019s really kind of you to share that with me. However, I\u2019m designed to be a safe and supportive space, and sharing personal details can sometimes be uncomfortable. \n\nWould you like to talk about something else? Perhaps we could talk about something more lighthearted or focus on positive things?"}

It sounds like you\u2019re going through something difficult.\n\nNow, I want to gently bring our conversation back to what we were talking about before.  It seems like you\u2019ve shared a lot \u2013 is there anything specific you\u2019d like to talk about or a topic you\u2019d like to focus on right now?"}

That\u2019s a significant relationship \u2013 it\u2019s good you\u2019re acknowledging that. \n\nLet\u2019s unpack this a bit. You\u2019ve already shared a lot \u2013 you\u2019re talking about a tough day and a relationship.  Right now, I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s anything you\u2019d like to focus on.  Is there a particular aspect of this relationship that\u2019s weighing on you, or are you just wanting to talk about it generally?"}

It\u2019s alright to want to understand the number of relationships. It\u2019s a natural thing to want to get a sense of the situation. However, I want to gently steer us back to what we were discussing before. \n\nWe were initially talking about how you\u2019re feeling about this relationship, and I\u2019m wondering if focusing on that would help you feel a bit more centered.  It\u2019s okay if you\u2019d prefer to move on to something else.  Would you like to talk about *why* you feel like you need to know the number, or perhaps share a little more about what\u2019s going on?"}
