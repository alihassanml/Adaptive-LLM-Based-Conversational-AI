It\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re feeling so overwhelmed right now \u2013 really. It takes a lot of courage to share something like that, and it\u2019s okay to feel all the way through \u2013 sadness, guilt, maybe even a little anger.  Just knowing you\u2019re carrying that weight with everyone\u2026 that\u2019s a really significant thing. \n\nHonestly, I just want you to know that it's alright to not be okay.  There\u2019s no right or wrong way to feel when you\u2019ve been grappling with something like this.  Do you want to\u2026 maybe just talk about *anything* at all, even if it\u2019s just a small piece?  And I\u2019m here to listen without judgment, if you need a safe space.\u201d\n\n**Here\u2019s a breakdown of why this response aims for that specific tone:**\n\n*   **Validation:** Starts by acknowledging their courage and the difficulty of the situation.\n*   **Gentle Reassurance:** Uses phrases like \"it's okay to feel\" and \"no right or wrong way\u201d to minimize pressure.\n*   **Emphasis on Understanding:**  \"Just want you to know...\" shows you\u2019re present and concerned.\n*   **Offer of Support:** \u201cI\u2019m here to listen\u201d is a direct offer of assistance without pushing for a full conversation.\n*   **Low Pressure:**  Phrasing like \u201csafe space\u201d suggests a non-judgmental environment.\n\n**Important Note:**  If the user continues to express intensely difficult emotions, it might be helpful to gently steer the conversation back to a more neutral topic \u2013 perhaps something about the weather or a shared interest, if that feels appropriate.  But this response focuses on being a supportive presence first.\n\nWould you like me to tweak this further, perhaps adding a specific question to encourage them to open up a little?"}
